        <h1>HI!</h1>
        <div id="line"></div>
        <p>Hello. my name is Sujit Narayanan. Denesh Raghavan. I live in India,Chennai. My age is 9+ and I am an NSO and IMO international rankerno.5 and 3 respectivsly. I am a;so a coder. I got interested in cycling when I saw my freinds riding bicycles while I was riding a bicycle with training wheels. I also wanted to ride like them so I asked my father to teach me cycling. As I had a great passion I could learn cycling in just a day. I was so proud that I could ride 5km in 1 Hour. If you are new to cycling I advise to put much passion into it to learn.my inspiration was Denise Mueller-Korenek, the fastest cyclist in the world.Denise Mueller-Korenek (born c. 1973) is an American cyclist. As of September 2018, she holds the world record for paced bicycle land speed[1][2] and is considered "the fastest cyclist on earth".[3][4] She set the record on September 16, 2018, at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, by traveling an average of 183.932 mph (296.009 km/h) on a custom-built carbon KHS bicycle behind a custom-built vehicle to minimize air resistance.[5] The previous record, 167 miles per hour (269 km/h), was set in 1995 by Dutchman Fred Rompelberg. Two years earlier she set the women's bicycle land speed record, pedaling 147.7 mph (237.7 km/h).[6] She is the first and only woman in history to hold the world record, which was first established in 1899.[7][8]Denise Mueller was born into a family of daredevils. Her father, Myron Mueller, was an ultra-distance cyclist; he celebrated his 70th birthday by pedaling the entire perimeter of the coterminous United States, a distance of more than 12,000 miles (19,000 km). He is in the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest person to bicycle that perimeter.[9] Her mother, Anna Dement, raced midget demolition-derby cars. "In our family, crazy is our sort of normal," Denise said.[6] She graduated from San Dieguito High School.[6]Mueller competed as a junior cyclist in her teens and finished in the top three in national and world competitions more than a dozen times.[10] She won national championships in road, track and mountain biking 15 times.[3] She retired in 1992 at age 19.[7] She went to work for her family's security company, eventually becoming president and CEO.[11]In 2009, Mueller-Korenek resumed bicycling and running, competing in marathons and Ironman Triathlon competitions. Her trainer, both in her teens and later, is John Howard, a three-time Olympian and holder of the world speed record before Rompelberg.[6] Mueller-Korenek decided to go for the speed record when Howard told her no woman had ever attempted it. She began seriously training to set a new bicycle speed record in 2012. Along the way she won two national titles for her age group.[8] In 2016, she made her first run at the record at the Bonneville Salt Flats. Her speed of 147.7 mph (237.7 km/h) established the women's world record.[8]In paced bicycle racing, the cyclist follows immediately behind a pace car equipped with a wind shield, so that they are pedaling in the car's slipstream. Riding at that speed just inches behind a pace car is so dangerous that most world-class cyclists do not attempt it.[6] The custom bicycle is geared so high that it has to be towed by the pace car until it reaches 90 to 100 miles per hour (140 to 160 km/h); the cyclist then casts off the towrope and pedals under their own power.[8] Rompelberg, whose record she was trying to break, encouraged her efforts and allowed her to use as a pace car the same custom 1,000-horsepower (750 kW) dragster he had used in setting the record.[12] The pace car was driven by professional race car driver Shea Holbrook.[10] In her 2018 attempt, Mueller-Korenek circled the track ​3 1⁄2 times after casting off the tow rope, breaking the world record on her final mile. Her goal had been to break the previous record of 167 mph (269 km/h); she was surprised to learn she had reached 183.9 mph (296.0 km/h), breaking Rompelberg's record by almost 17 mph (27 km/h).</p>
